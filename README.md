How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/stellarmercenary/fullstack-web-zenlesszone.git
   cd fullstack-web-zenlesszone

2. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend
   You need to run the install command separately in both folders:

    - In the frontend folder:
      cd frontend
      npm install

    - In the backend folder:
      cd ../backend
      npm install

3. Start the backend and frontend servers
   Open two separate terminals and run the following commands:

    - For backend (inside the backend folder):
      node server.js

    - For frontend (inside the frontend folder):
      npm run dev

---

Important: Don’t forget to run npm install in both frontend and backend folders before starting the servers to make sure all packages are installed.
