## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/stellarmercenary/fullstack-web-zenlesszone.git
   cd fullstack-web-zenlesszone

2. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend
   Run the install command separately in each folder:

    - In the frontend folder:
      cd frontend
      npm install

    - In the backend folder:
      cd ../backend
      npm install

3. Start the backend and frontend servers
   You can run them in two separate terminals or use concurrently (see notes):

    - For backend (inside the backend folder):
      node server.js

    - For frontend (inside the frontend folder):
      npm run dev

4. (Optional) Run both servers simultaneously from the root folder:

    - Make sure dependencies installed in root (concurrently):
      npm install

    - Run both servers with one command:
      npm start

---

Important: Donâ€™t forget to run npm install in both frontend and backend folders before starting the servers to make sure all packages are installed.
